    <h1>Scroller Site</h1>
    <div><p>I made a dynamic website with django, it's mostly an exercise learning and applying new features which I learned about or wished to try. It ended up being usesable, so it exists on a digital ocean droplet for now.</p>
<p><img alt="Front Page" src="/images/scroller.jpeg"></p>
<p>I had to learn how to incorporate a CI CD pipeline into this project in order to be able to serve it timely. I decided docker would be an acceptable way to package it, as I could easily run it locally to make sure new features worked before pushing it to be tested.</p>
<p>It incorporate infinite scrolling with the use of htmx, a very useful js library. I enjoyed writing the backend as it was a good introduction to Django's ORM. It was also nice to see how django's integral user management system merely needs a few html templates and url routes to impliment.</p>
<p>Functionally speaking, it's essentially a clone of twitter/9gag or any scroller site you can think of, stripped of most features, but incorporating concepts from traditional forms and imageboards. In order to conserve reasources, the backend simply deletes any post older than 24 hours on a rolling schedule. Once an hour, posts are deleted and their associated comments are deleted. If the total amount of storage exceeds a threshold, the oldest posts are deleted first to make way for new activity.</p>
<p>I intend to incorporate more feature</p></div>
