    <div><p>I made a dynamic website with django, it's mostly an exercise learning and applying new features which I learned about or wished to try. It ended up being usesable, so it exists on a digital ocean droplet for now.</p>

<p>I had to learn how to incorporate a CI CD pipeline into this project in order to be able to serve it timely. It incorporate infinite scrolling with the use of htmx, a very useful js library. I enjoyed writing the backend as it was a good introduction to Django's ORM.</p>
<p>It was also nice to see how django's integral user management system merely needs a few html templates and url routes to impliment.</p></div>
